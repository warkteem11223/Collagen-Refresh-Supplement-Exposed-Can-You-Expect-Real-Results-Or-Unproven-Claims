<span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding Collagen Refresh:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Collagen, the protein responsible for maintaining skin's firmness and suppleness, naturally declines with age, leading to wrinkles, fine lines, and sagging skin. Collagen Refresh aims to combat this decline by providing a potent blend of ingredients designed to replenish and revitalize collagen levels in the skin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Ingredients:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collagen Peptides: These amino acids serve as the building blocks for collagen production, helping to restore skin's structural integrity and improve its texture.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyaluronic Acid: Known for its hydrating properties, hyaluronic acid locks in moisture, plumping the skin and reducing the appearance of wrinkles.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin C: A powerful antioxidant, vitamin C aids in brightening the complexion, evening out skin tone, and protecting against environmental damage.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retinol: Renowned for its anti-aging benefits, retinol stimulates collagen production, enhances cell turnover, and diminishes the signs of aging.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peptides: These small protein molecules penetrate deep into the skin, promoting collagen synthesis and improving overall skin elasticity.</span></li>
</ul>
